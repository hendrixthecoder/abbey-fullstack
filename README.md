# Abbey Interview Test 

## Description:
This is a banking website, built on React(TypeScript), NodeJS/Express and MongoDB. It features user authentication, account creation, ability to make transactions, store these records, fetch them, add beneficiaries(relationships) etc. 

### Things to note:
- Giving the request to make something simple but functional frontend to backend, I focused more on functionality than decor.
- Also, still concerning the matter of simplicity. I realize that an actual banking web app would require more than using Local Storage for client side authentification but decided to go with that for the sake of simplicity. Hence tokens for user identification were in fact stored in the client side.
